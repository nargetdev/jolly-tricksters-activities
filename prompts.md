Your inner knowing is your only true compass

Your values are the best compass for your journey

Creativity is like a compass each has it's own, and all point north.

The bible does not provide a map of life, only a compass

Your heart is your compass always leading you back to center.

Live your life by a compass not a clock.

Fear is not your enemy it is a compass pointing where you need to go.


# Affirmations

Is it true?  Is it necessary? Is it kind?

Being wanted feeds the ego, being valued feeds the soul.

Perhaps our eyes need to be washed by our tears once in a while, so that we can see life with a clearer view once again.

We're all made of stardust.
